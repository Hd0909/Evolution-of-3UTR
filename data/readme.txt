gene_age.txt: file contains  age idntification of human genes and it was obtained from the supplementary table 1 of the Yin et al.'s paper[1]
all_gene.csv: file contains the TSGs , Oncogenes , Non-cancer genes  list we used in our previous paper[2].The TSG and oncogene lists were obtained from the TSGene2.0[3] database and Vogelstein's review[4], respectively, as we previously described[3,5-6]. Genes not in these lists were considered as non-cancer genes.
